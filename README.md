# Caster - Inspired from the 2D Lights and Shadows project. (Asset removal may occur)

Check out the 2D Lights and Shadows demo on the asset library: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/116

# !DEVELOPER NOTE!
Currently the game engine Caster is being developed on is having a major release soon!
This engine is going to open so many doors for Caster and it's new syntax for GDScript is insane!
But, this is happening in a few days, which means I'm going to try to labor myself as best as possible.
I work a full-time job so I have less free time to develop my game to a better state.
I'm not sure, but core development may be slightly unrefiend and not production ready, so this master branch will
live far behind for a while...
Please remember I'm working hard on all the mechanics to make this game as advanced user and user friendly as possible.
I'll be making some temporary work arounds for the OBUS (On-Board updating system), which I've been quiet about but a soon to be published dev log will reveal a lot about the roadmap for the up and coming release for caster and it's modding capabilities and potential to change modding as we know it at least for godot.

Please be paitent while I prepare the project for these massive changes.

Note: Older versions of Caster will stay in the 3.4.x area, while 2.5.x will be upgraded to godot 4.0

What's missing..

    Ideas aside from a monster and a top-down player.
    Boundaries for the player
    A map (Literally just a open space that you can move around in)
    Bullet collision actually doing something other than deleting the bullets.
    Shadows but it's just disabled until it's useful.
    Other stuff.

My goals?

   I want to make a 2D top-down horror game with a monster and the player with a story / extra gamemodes and map designing. (Very hard for my brain)
   I also want there to be a dedicated server side for multiplayer (If this goes into early access, then I will consider it later down the line).

Why am I doing this?

   I am a developer who wants to continue making games, but I recently swapped to Linux, I used to use unity but the unity support for Linux is bad at the moment, so I want to make 2D games in the mean time in Godot. Mainly to further my knowledge of 2D and become a pro at 2D horror!
   I'm new to Godot and this is the project I want to start learning Godot with and I'm terrible at math and failed school so movement and other velocity things hurt my brain, but I'm learning as I go.
    To reinforce my understanding of vectors and physics in 2D.

I need help!

   If you are willing to share knowledge in game development, math, or just give ideas for the projects features / core mechanics / story. Then I would absolutely appreciate any help!!!! This is possibly a community aided project until I can develop games entirely on my own. Assets and other things are hard for me to make, so help / reference for that would be amazing, I need to learn more.
   While I am new to Godot, and untrained, development may be slow, this is because it takes time to learn artistic subjects and the editor itself. Please bare with me as I learn. Once I have learned enough, you can expect development to speed up a bit.
