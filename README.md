# !DEVELOPER NOTE!
Currently the game engine Caster is being developed on is having a major release soon!
This engine is going to open so many doors for Caster and it's new syntax for GDScript is insane!
But, this is happening in a few days, which means I'm going to try to labor myself as best as possible.
I work a full-time job so I have less free time to develop my game to a better state.
I'm not sure, but core development may be slightly unrefiend and not production ready, so this master branch will
live far behind for a while...
Please remember I'm working hard on all the mechanics to make this game as advanced user and user friendly as possible.
I'll be making some temporary work arounds for the OBUS (On-Board updating system), which I've been quiet about but a soon to be published dev log will reveal a lot about the roadmap for the up and coming release for caster and it's modding capabilities and potential to change modding as we know it at least for godot.

Please be paitent while I prepare the project for these massive changes.

Note: Older versions of Caster will stay in the 3.4.x area, while 2.5.x will be upgraded to godot 4.0
Critical Note: Mod/Map development for caster v0.2.5 down will require require older versions of godot unless ported.
Critical Note: Mods developed for caster versions older than v0.2.5.2 may not fuction properly or at all.


Language: GDScript
Renderer: GLES 3
